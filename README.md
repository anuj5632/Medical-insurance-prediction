Medical Insurance Cost Prediction using Machine Learning
This project builds a machine learning model to predict medical insurance costs based on factors like age, BMI, smoking status, number of dependents, and region. The model helps insurance companies and individuals estimate healthcare expenses efficiently.

Features
Dataset: Uses a structured dataset with demographic and health-related features.

Preprocessing: Handles missing values, encodes categorical variables, and normalizes numerical features.

Modeling: Implements regression models such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, or Gradient Boosting.

Evaluation: Measures model performance using RMSE, MAE, and RÂ² score.

Deployment: Can be integrated into applications for real-time insurance cost estimation.

Result
The model provides accurate predictions based on health and demographic factors. Performance metrics and visualizations are included in the notebook
